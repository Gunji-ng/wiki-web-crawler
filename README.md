Project Title
Wiki Web Crawler

Description
This Python application is a web crawler that gets the first article link on a wikipedia page, opens the said link and gets the first article link on this new page then repeats the process until we get to the wiki/Science page.
The starting page is gotten from the user's input and crawling can be terminated before getting to the final result when certain conditions occur.
